<p>It's the thought of being young
<br>When your heart's just like a drum
<br>Beating louder with no way to guard it
<br>When it all seems like it's wrong
<br>Just sing along to Elton John
<br>And to that feeling, we're just getting started
<br>When the nights get colder
<br>And the rhythms got you falling behind
<br>Just dream about that moment
<br>When you look yourself right in the eye, eye, eye
<br>Then you say
<p>I wanna dance
<br>The music's got me going
<br>Ain't nothing that can stop how we move yeah
<br>Let's break our plans
<br>And live just like we're golden
<br>And roll in like we're dancing fools
<p>We don't need to worry
<br>'Cause when we fall we know how to land
<br>Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
<br>'Cause we don't need permission to dance
<br>There's always something that's standing in the way
<br>But if you don't let it faze ya
<br>You'll know just how to break
<br>Just keep the right vibe yeah
<br>'Cause there's no looking back
<br>There ain't no one to prove
<br>We don't got this on lock yeah
<br>The wait is over
<br>The time is now so let's do it right
<br>Yeah we'll keep going
<br>And stay up until we see the sunrise
<br>And we'll say
<p>I wanna dance
<br>The music's got me going
<br>Ain't nothing that can stop how we move yeah
<br>Let's break our plans
<br>And live just like we're golden
<br>And roll in like we're dancing fools
<br>We don't need to worry
<br>'Cause when we fall we know how to land
<br>Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
<br>'Cause we don't need permission to dance

<br>That we can keep the fire alive
<p>'Cause it's not over
<br>Till it's over say it one more time

<p>I wanna dance
<br>The music's got me going
<br>Ain't nothing that can stop how we move yeah
